  <summary><b>Deploy to your VPS</b></summary>

<br>

**Make a vps (Recommended - Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64) and log in to it)**
- Then execute the below commands. 👇
```sh  
sudo apt update
```
```sh  
sudo apt upgrade
```
```sh  
apt-get update
```
```sh  
apt-get install tmux
```
```sh  
tmux
```
**Now there are two methods to go further!**
- Method 1
  
  - Fork my repo. In the repo go inside to the `sample_config.py` and copy all the code in it. In your forked repo, create a file named `config.py` and paste the whole code in it. 
  - Then edit the values in it with your values! (Example of how to edit is mentioned in the `config.py` file.)
  - Then execute the below commands. 👇

```sh  
git clone You_forked_repo_url
```
```sh  
apt install python3-pip
```
```sh  
apt install ffmpeg
```
```sh  
cd mega-link-downloader-bot
```
```sh  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh  
python3 bot.py
```
Now If you did everything correctly bot will be running successfully! 🥳

- Method 2

  - Execute the below commands. 👇

```sh  
git clone https://github.com/XMYSTERlOUSX/mega-link-downloader-bot
```
```sh  
apt install python3-pip
```
```sh  
apt install ffmpeg
```
```sh  
cd mega-link-downloader-bot
```
```sh  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh  
cp sample_config.py config.py
```
```sh  
nano config.py
```
  - Now you will be inside the `config.py` file.
  - Then edit the values in it with your values! (Example of how to edit is mentioned in the `config.py` file.)
  - (For pasting letters, copy any value you want and take the curser to the place you want by arrow keys and right click the mouse! 😅)
  - After editing all with appropriate values as mentioned in the config file press Ctrl + X from your keyboard.
  - Then press y in your keyboard.
  - Then execute the below command. 👇
  
```sh  
python3 bot.py
```
Now If you did everything correctly bot will be running successfully! 🥳

### Reason for making this open source :-

First of all I am an absolute noob😇🥺 (You can ensure it if you see the code even just once😂)

So when I was going through github in search for finding a mega link downloader bot code or a plugin in <b>pyrogram</b> I found nothing!🥺😞

(Cat userbot and ultroid userbot has a mega link downloader plugin. Also mirror bots have the mega link download feature but none of them were pyrogram.)

I didn't wan't to change the [@mysterious_uploader_robot](https://t.me/mysterious_uploader_robot) 's whole base to telethon just for the feature of downloading mega links!😑😒 So I decided to make a plugin on my own, based on pyrogram. 🤷‍♀️

The code was originally made as a plugin for my [@mysterious_uploader_robot](https://t.me/mysterious_uploader_robot) but <b>when a mega link is being downloaded the bot became unresponsive for other users!</b>

Tried various ways to fix it but I couldn't, because as mentioned above I am a total noob!😔

So for that reason had to make separate bot for it!

<b>For the help of any guy like me in this world who is wondering how to make a bot for downloading mega links, or for whoever that is finding a code to download mega links; thought to make this public. 😇❤️</b>
